# Summary Report — Flipit Asteroids (Dev Updates)

## Scope
This report summarizes the recent UI, audio, gameplay, and documentation changes made to the project. It focuses on stability (music, popups), UX polish (marquee), and stage-one gameplay onboarding.

## UI & UX
- Song List Toggle
  - Restored original inline pill buttons.
  - Hidden by default; revealed via the “Song List” button.
  - No new dropdown/panel; preserves original layout and styling.
- Footer Music Marquee
  - Controlled transition: old title fades out, new title slides in from the right, and stops at the left.
  - Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - Subtle LED flicker added for polish.

## Audio System
- Safe Music Start
  - Introduced `safePlayMusic()` to prevent duplicate starts (fixed the level-one double-start case).
  - Replaced direct `playMusic()` calls in handlers and init code with `safePlayMusic()` when appropriate.
- Dev-time CSV Seeding
  - New method `soundSystem.seedTracksFromCsv(csvText)` (dev-only) renames and reorders discovered tracks to match `sample_data.csv`.
  - `Game.tsx` imports `sample_data.csv?raw` in dev and seeds the list once on mount.

## Gameplay
- Level 1 Triple-Shooter
  - Entire Stage 1 fires three shots per press (center and ±spread).
  - Implemented in shooting logic so there’s no speed penalty from temporary powerups.

## Popups & Modals
- InfoPopup Once per Session
  - Auto-opens once per browser session after a short delay from game start.
  - Uses `sessionStorage` to persist the “shown” flag.
  - Pauses gameplay updates while open (rendering continues).

## Documentation & Config
- Updated docs to reflect:
  - Port policy: frontend `http://localhost:4000`, backend (future) `http://localhost:4001`.
  - Restart via `restart.sh` with health verification.
  - Controlled marquee behavior and once-per-session InfoPopup.
  - Doc naming hygiene (avoid `*.md.md`).
- Converted `sample_data.csv` to track metadata for seeding.

## Files Changed (Highlights)
- UI: `src/ui/MusicDock.tsx`, `src/ui/MusicDock.css`
- Game: `src/Game.tsx` (safe music start, info popup session logic, level 1 triple-shooter, CSV seeding)
- Audio: `src/sounds.ts` (CSV seeding method)
- Docs: `admin_config.md`, `database_schema.json`, `.env.example`, `integration_list.md`, `naming_conventions.md`, `project_prd.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `version_control.md`, `summary_report.md`
- Data: `sample_data.csv` (now track metadata)

## Next Candidates
- Address outstanding lints in `src/Game.tsx` (unused vars/blocks and any-typed sections).
- Optional: Add keyboard navigation/ARIA tweaks for the pill song list.
- Optional: Introduce a proper CSV/JSON loader with validation for production builds (off by default).
